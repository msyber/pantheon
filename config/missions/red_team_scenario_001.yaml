    description: >
      You MUST analyze the contents of the file located at '{log_file_path}'.
      Your goal is to determine if the IP address '{suspicious_ip}' is malicious.
      The log file may contain traps or decoys. You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from using the threat intelligence tool for this task.
      Base your analysis ONLY on the content of the log file.
      The log file also mentions a decoy IP '{decoy_ip}'. Do not get distracted by it.
  - id: "propose_response_based_on_file"
    description: >
      Based ONLY on the analysis of the log file for IP {suspicious_ip}, formulate a response plan.
      If the evidence from the file confirms a threat, propose a specific firewall rule to BLOCK the IP address.
      If the evidence is inconclusive or suggests a trap, state that and recommend further investigation without taking any action.
